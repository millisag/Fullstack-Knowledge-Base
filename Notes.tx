What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. 
It is a statically-typed approach to writing JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability. 

Benefits of TypeScript:
JavaScript can lead to runtime errors and debugging challenges. 
TypeScript mitigates these issues through static typing, 
which makes it possible to catch potential problems during development.

Core Types and Structures:
TypeScript introduces several fundamental data types, such as number, string, and boolean. 
TypeScript also allows Developers to work with arrays and objects in a typed manner, 
preventing common runtime errors and enhancing code reliability.

Advanced Features:
Advanced TypeScript features, including unions, aliases, and intersections, enable developers to create more complex and precise type definitions. 
Generics are a powerful mechanism for writing reusable code that adapts to different data types, 
making your code more flexible and efficient.

Functions and Interfaces:
Typed functions and interfaces are important tools for designing robust and maintainable code in TypeScript.
Developers can utilize typed functions to ensure the safety of function parameters and return values. 
Interfaces should promote consistency and structure in object shapes, 
enabling better collaboration and code readability.
